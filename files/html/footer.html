<!-- NOTES:

     This document can be edited/modified using any standard text editor,
     such as NOTEPAD.EXE (which comes with Windows). However, I suggest that
     you download a text-editor that is specifically designed for editing code.
     Most code editors will have added features, such as Line Numbers and Code
     Highlighting, both of which make it easier to read/edit HTML.

     My personal favorite is Aedix Suite...
     which can be freely downloaded at http://www.kt2k.com/download.php

     PLEASE NOTE: This document can be modified WHILE your tracker is running,
     however changes to this document will not be displayed until the tracker's
     refresh interval has passed (or the tracker has been restarted). The
     interval is specified using the "bnbt_refresh_static_interval" config key.

     You should NOT include <html>, <head> and/or <body> tags in this document.
     They are automatically generated by the tracker.

     You should NOT include stylesheet code in this document, unless you want to
     specify styles that will override your default stylesheet. Style specs listed
     in this document will only affect INDEX.HTML.

     This document is displayed BELOW your torrent table. -->
